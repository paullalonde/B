<h2>DragPeekerX Sample</h2>
<p>A re-creation for Mac OS X of a utility that used to come with the
Macintosh Drag and Drop SDK.&nbsp; It consists of a window that one can
drag things into.&nbsp; The window displays a dump of the drag's
contents.</p>
<p>The main classes are described next.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>The main application class. This class derives from <tt>B::Application&lt;B::NullDocumentPolicy,
B::NullPrintPolicy&gt;</tt>, which is a long way of saying that it's a
documentless application (because its document policy is <tt>B::NullDocumentPolicy</tt>),
and that it doesn't support printing (because its print policy is <tt>B::</tt><tt>NullPrintPolicy</tt>).</p>
<p>The class is very simple.&nbsp; The only function longer than a few
lines is <tt>CreateDragPeekerWindow()</tt>, which creates a new drag
peeker window.</p>
<h3>DragPeekerView</h3>
<p>This class is a custom view that displays the contents of a
drag.&nbsp; It demonstrates the following techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Custom HIView development with the B framework.</li>
  <li>Embeddability within an HIScrollView.</li>
  <li>Responding to drag &amp; drop actions.</li>
  <li>Drawing with CoreGraphics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mac OS X 10.4 (aka Tiger).</li>
  <li>One of :
    <ul>
        <li>Xcode 2.1</li>
        <li>CodeWarrior 10.0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
The use of SDKs (to cross compile) has not been tested.&nbsp; YMMV.
