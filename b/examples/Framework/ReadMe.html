<h2>Framework Sample</h2>
<p><em>Note: In the following text, the word "framework" is used in the
sense of the packaging convention specific to Mac OS X, and not in the
sense of "application framework".</em></p>
<p>The enclosed Xcode and CodeWarrior projects show how to build B as a
framework.</p>
<p>The projects build a "private" framework &#8211; i.e., there aren't any
headers copied into the built framework hierarchy.&nbsp; The reason for
this is there is currently no standard ABI (Application Binary
Interface) for C++ compilers on Mac OS X. This means that in general,
code generated by one compiler can't call code generated by a different
compiler, or even a different version of the same compiler. So it's
dangerous to expose a C++ interface to a framework, where it could
potentially be linked to by code generated by an incompatible compiler.</p>
<p>A C++ framework only makes sense if every client linking to it uses
the same version of the compiler as the framework itself.<br>
</p>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mac OS X 10.4 (aka Tiger).</li>
  <li>One of :
    <ul>
        <li>Xcode 2.1</li>
        <li>CodeWarrior 10.0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
The use of SDKs (to cross compile) has not been tested.&nbsp; YMMV.
