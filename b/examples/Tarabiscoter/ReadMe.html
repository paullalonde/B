<h2>Tarabiscoter Sample</h2>
<p>This sample application is a grab-bag showing various techniques
and/or features of B.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>&nbsp;
The features demonstrated by the application are accessible from the
Test menu.&nbsp; They are enumerated below.<br>
</p>
<h3>Drawers</h3>
<p>Displays a window with three drawers, on the left, right and bottom
edges.&nbsp; A button on each edge toggles the visibility of
corresponding drawer.&nbsp; Code-wise, it's a simple use of the Drawer
class.<br>
</p>
<h3>Layout [Compositing]</h3>
Demonstrate the layout support in B.&nbsp; By choosing from different
popup menus on the left, you change the layout information for one of
the bevel buttons on the right (the one labelled "Victim").<br>
<h3>Layout [Non-Compositing]</h3>
Same as above, except the window is non-compositing.&nbsp; The contents
of both windows are identical.&nbsp; It's a handy way of comparing the
difference in behaviour between the two.<br>
<h3>Split</h3>
Demonstrates SplitView, which is a class currently under development
that manages two subviews and performs cursor tracking.<br>
<h3>Modal Dialog</h3>
Demonstrates the AutoWindow and Dialog classes.&nbsp; Displays an
application-modal dialog.<br>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mac OS X 10.4 (aka Tiger).</li>
  <li>One of :
    <ul>
        <li>Xcode 2.1</li>
        <li>CodeWarrior 10.0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
The use of SDKs (to cross compile) has not been tested.&nbsp; YMMV.
<h3>FAQ<br>
</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">What is tarabiscoter?</span><br>
<br>
Tarabiscoter is a French verb (pronounced "tah-rah-bees-coh-tay") which
in its figurative sense means
"to complicate unnecessarily".&nbsp; It's an allusion to the fact that
the
application is a collection of contrived examples :)
